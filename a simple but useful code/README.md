This method is to help you find duplicate features and reset the columns!
This code greatly simplifies a lot of manual work in my work.  
It's simple, but because it's so useful, I think it really means a lot to me. 
I create it in the first week of my first full-time job.
Just be free to use this valueble code. Thanks for reading!
