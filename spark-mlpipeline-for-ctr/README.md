Description : 

I designed this algorithm mainly for the company I worked in order to help accelerate the training speed and accuracy with regards to their big data business. This algorithm adds the functions of feature selection and hyperparametric search and integrated a series of spark machine learning algorithms. And I also design a creative algorithm blending scheme which can greatly improve the accuracy of the prediction. By using this code, it does not need any preprocessing of data sets, and the selection of features or algorithms. Although it can help companies to be more efficient and accurate in CTR prediction, this project is not always to get the most accurate algorithm. Sometimes it may need to construct some effective features manually to improve the accuracy of prediction.
